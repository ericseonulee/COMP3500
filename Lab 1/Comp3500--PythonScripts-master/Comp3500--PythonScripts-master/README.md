# Comp3500--PythonScripts



You need to mkdir output1.txt, output2.txt, output3.txt in your working directory. 
Run the ./pm 1 >> output1.txt to redirect the terminals output to the file you made.
Then run the python script in the same directory with your output1.txt/output2.txt/output3.txt. 

It will generate csv1/ csv2/csv3 in the same directory. Then you can open those up with Excel.

Sorry, this was made really quick/inefficient, but it's the only way I can think of to automate the graph part.
